# gaic_2025_draft

## 1. Introduction
This is a draft repo for the Gator AI Summer Camp 2025 program. The camp will teach students the basics of AI and how to apply AI to solve real-world problems.

The first week will consist of teaching Python using game development. The second week will focus on teaching AI concepts and how to apply them to solve real-world problems.

The game will be a top-down adventure game, similar to the Legend of Zelda. The player will be able to move around the map, collect items, and interact with NPCs.

All of the code in the project should be well-documented and follow best practices. The goal is to teach students how to write clean, maintainable code that can be easily understood by others.
The code should also be organized to teach coding principles in a logical order. For example, students should learn about variables and functions before classes and objects.

## 2. Week 1: Python Basics

The first week will focus on teaching students the basics of Python by modifying an existing game. Students will learn about variables, data types, functions, loops, and conditionals through hands-on experience altering the game code.

### 2.1 Day 1: Introduction to Python and Game Overview
- Introduction to Python
- Installing Python
- Running Python scripts
- Overview of the game project
- Understanding the game structure
- Variables and data types

### 2.2 Day 2: Functions and Loops in the Game
- Functions
- Loops
- Modifying game behaviors
- Working with lists and arrays
- List comprehensions
- Implementing dictionaries

### 2.3 Day 3: Game Logic with Conditionals and Modules
- Conditionals
- Enhancing game logic
- Modules and libraries
- Using Pip for package management
- Integrating external libraries

### 2.4 Day 4: File I/O and Error Handling in the Game
- File I/O
- Reading and writing game data
- Error handling
- Try and except blocks
- Debugging the game

### 2.5 Day 5: Presenting Modified Game Projects
- Final project work
- Implementing new game features
- Testing and refining
- Presenting the modified game
